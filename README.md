I am an IT undergraduate at SLIIT campus with a strong interest in starting my career in Software
development.
I would like to learn and gather experience in projects, while performing my tasks with commitment and
dedication in line with organizational objectives.
I am willing to take the opportunity to be part of an organization that utilizes my competence and skills
towards the growth of the organization.
